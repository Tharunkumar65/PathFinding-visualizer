# Path Visualizer React App

[Currently live on here](#) 

## Overview

This React application is designed to demonstrate three popular graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm. It provides a visual representation of these algorithms by allowing users to create a grid of nodes and manipulate them to simulate different scenarios.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for easy management of UI elements and state.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used in the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the structure and styling of the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first design.
- **React-Bootstrap**: React components implementing Bootstrap UI components.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for running the application.
- **npm**: Package manager for JavaScript used for installing and managing dependencies.
- **Create React App**: Tool for creating React applications with pre-configured setup and build scripts.

## Algorithms

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - Traverses or searches a graph in breadthward motion, exploring all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level. Guarantees finding the shortest path between the starting node and any other node in the grid.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
   - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Useful for exploring all possible paths in the grid.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Utilizes a priority queue to explore nodes in a greedy manner, considering edge weights to find the shortest path.

## Usage

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
  ```
